# 💫 About Me
I am a software engineer on a mission to master the full lifecycle of modern applications. Currently, I am bridging the gap between Phase 1 (Frontend) and Phase 2 (Backend) of my development journey, with a strong focus on building responsive UIs using React.js and Tailwind CSS, while architecting robust server-side logic with Java. I don't just want to build apps that look good; I want to understand how they talk to the database, how they scale in the cloud, and how they stay secure.

My passion lies in system architecture and automation. Following my structured learning pathway, I am moving beyond simple coding into Phase 3 (Infrastructure), where I explore the power of Docker, AWS, and CI/CD pipelines. My ultimate goal is to reach Phase 4 (Expert Level), evolving into a Full-Stack Engineer who specializes in DevSecOps and system reliability. I am a firm believer in "learning by doing," and I am constantly seeking challenges that force me to dive deeper into the terminal, optimize a database query, or secure a cloud environment.

🔭 I’m currently working on Merging Phase 1 and 2: Developing a full-stack application using React.js for the frontend and Java (Spring Boot) for the backend, focusing on building efficient REST APIs.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Open-source projects that involve Tailwind CSS components or Java-based microservices. I’m eager to contribute to repositories that have a clear CI/CD structure.

🤝 I’m looking for help with Phase 3 (Infrastructure): Specifically, best practices for Dockerizing Java applications and setting up automated deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions.

🌱 I’m currently learning Deep-diving into Node.js and Express to broaden my backend versatility, while exploring PostgreSQL for complex relational data modeling.

💬 Ask me about JavaScript ES6+ logic, React hooks, or why I chose Java for enterprise-grade stability. I can also talk about my journey through the Linux command line.

⚡ Fun fact I view my career like a deployment pipeline: I’m currently in the Build phase, constantly Testing new technologies, so I can eventually Deploy myself as a Senior DevSecOps Architect!
